**cPanel Bulk Package Updater**

A production-ready bash script for bulk updating cPanel account packages via WHM API. Designed to solve package specification synchronization issues between billing systems (like WHMCS) and cPanel servers.

**🎯 Problem Statement**

Have you ever encountered situations where:
- cPanel accounts are assigned to one package but use specs from another? 
- WHMCS shows a different number of accounts on a package than what is actually on the server?
- Accounts aren't respecting their assigned package limits and quotas?
- You need to update thousands of accounts across multiple servers but clicking through WHM one-by-one is impractical?

This script was battle-tested on 14 production servers managing over 35,000 accounts, solving package synchronization issues that would have taken months to fix manually.

**✨ Features**
- **Enterprise-Scale Processing**: Successfully deployed across 14 servers with 35,000+ accounts
- **Bulk Processing**: Handle thousands of accounts efficiently per server
- **Package-Based Organization**: Separate user lists for each package type
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs with timestamps for audit trails
- **Error Handling**: Validates users exist before attempting updates
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress display with success/failure counts
- **Safe for Suspended Accounts**: Updates package specs without changing suspension status
- **Server-Friendly**: Built-in delays to prevent API overload
- **Summary Statistics**: Per-package and overall completion summaries
- **Multi-Server Ready**: Standardized approach for deploying across multiple servers

**📋 Requirements**
- WHM/cPanel server with root access
- cPanel/WHM API access (whmapi1)
- Bash shell (typically pre-installed on cPanel servers)
- Root or sudo privileges

**🚀 Installation**
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/temitrace/cpanel-bulk-package-updater.git
cd cpanel-bulk-package-updater
```
2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x bulk_package_update.sh
```
3. Create your package user lists:
```bash
vi package1
vi package2
vi package3
# etc.
 ```  
 
**📝 Usage**

**Step 1:** Prepare Your User Lists
Create text files named after your cPanel packages (lowercase). Each file should contain one username per line.

Example file structure:
```plaintext
/root/cpanel-bulk-package-updater/
├── bulk_package_update.sh
├── basic
├── standard
├── premium
└── enterprise
```
Example file content (basic):
```plaintext
user1
user2
user3
# Comments are ignored
user4
```
**Step 2:** Verify Current Package Distribution (BEFORE Running Script)
Check how many accounts are in each package:
```bash
for user in $(ls /var/cpanel/users/); do grep "PLAN=" /var/cpanel/users/$user; done | cut -d'=' -f2 | sort | uniq -c
```
Example output:
```plaintext
145 Basic
89 Standard
16 Premium
12 Enterprise
```
Check specific accounts in a particular package:
```bash
# Replace "Basic" with your package name
for user in $(ls /var/cpanel/users/); do pkg=$(grep "PLAN=" /var/cpanel/users/$user | cut -d'=' -f2); [ "$pkg" = "Basic" ] && echo "$user"; done
```
Save the BEFORE snapshot for comparison:
```bash
for user in $(ls /var/cpanel/users/); do grep "PLAN=" /var/cpanel/users/$user; done | cut -d'=' -f2 | sort | uniq -c > package_distribution_before.txt
```
**Step 3:** Configure Package Names

Edit the script and update the package names to match YOUR cPanel packages:
```bash
# Find this section in the script and update with your package names:
process_package "Basic" "basic"
process_package "Standard" "standard"
process_package "Premium" "premium"
process_package "Enterprise" "enterprise"
```
Important:

First parameter = Capitalized package name (as it appears in WHM)
Second parameter = Lowercase filename

**Step 4:** Run the Script
```bash
cd /root/cpanel-bulk-package-updater
./bulk_package_update.sh
```
**Step 5:** Monitor Progress
In another terminal, monitor the log in real-time:
```bash
tail -f /root/cpanel-bulk-package-updater/bulk_package_update_*.log
```
**Step 6:** Verify Results (AFTER Running Script)
Check the new package distribution:
```bash
for user in $(ls /var/cpanel/users/); do grep "PLAN=" /var/cpanel/users/$user; done | cut -d'=' -f2 | sort | uniq -c
```
Example output (after):
```plaintext
145 Basic
89 Standard
203 Premium  <- Fixed! Was 16, now 203
85 Enterprise  <- Fixed! Was 12, now 85
 ```    
Save the AFTER snapshot:
```bash
for user in $(ls /var/cpanel/users/); do grep "PLAN=" /var/cpanel/users/$user; done | cut -d'=' -f2 | sort | uniq -c > package_distribution_after.txt
```
Compare before and after:
```bash
echo "=== BEFORE ==="
cat package_distribution_before.txt
echo ""
echo "=== AFTER ==="
cat package_distribution_after.txt
```
Verify specific accounts were updated:
```bash
# Check accounts that should now be on Basic
for user in $(ls /var/cpanel/users/); do pkg=$(grep "PLAN=" /var/cpanel/users/$user | cut -d'=' -f2); [ "$pkg" = "Basic" ] && echo "$user"; done | wc -l
```
**🔧 Configuration**

You can customize these variables at the top of the script:
```bash
SCRIPT_DIR="/root/cpanel-bulk-package-updater"  # Change to your preferred directory
DELAY=1  # Seconds between API calls (increase for heavily loaded servers)
```
**📊 Example Output**

**⚠️ Important Notes**

Before Running in Production:

- **Test on a few accounts first**: Comment out most users in your files and test with 5-10 accounts
- **Backup your server**: Always maintain current backups before bulk operations
- **Check during off-peak hours**: For large batches, run during low-traffic periods
- **Review your package names**: Ensure they match exactly (case-sensitive)

**What This Script Does:**

✅ Updates package specifications (disk, bandwidth, feature limits)  
✅ Changes account quotas and restrictions  
✅ Works on suspended accounts without changing suspension status

**What This Script Does NOT Do:**

❌ Change account suspension/activation status  
❌ Modify website files or databases  
❌ Alter email accounts or configurations  
❌ Change DNS records or SSL certificates  
❌ Affect IP addresses or domain ownership

**🐛 Troubleshooting**

"User not found" errors

```bash
# Verify user exists in WHM:
whmapi1 accountsummary user=username
# Check the username in your file has no extra spaces or special characters
```
Script fails to execute
```bash
# Ensure script has execute permissions:
chmod +x bulk_package_update.sh
# Verify you're running as root:
whoami
```
Package name not recognized
```bash
# List all available packages in WHM:
whmapi1 listpkgs
# Ensure your package names match exactly (case-sensitive)
```
**📖 How It Works**
1. **Reads user lists**: Processes each package file sequentially
2. **Validates users**: Checks if each user exists on the server
3. **Gets current package**: Retrieves the user's current package assignment
4. **Executes API call**: Runs whmapi1 changepackage for each user
5. **Logs results**: Records success/failure for each operation
6. **Generates summary**: Provides statistics for each package
